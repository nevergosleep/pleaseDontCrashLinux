Fixed RTV. It needed to be updated. The newest package was only available on Debian Unstable [Sid]. Was able to upgrade using 'pip', a Python installer. First had to install PIP, then RTV
!Had to restart computer before RTV worked!!!
	
"	apt install python-pip    " (for python2)
or"     apt install python3-pip   " (for python3)
"	pip install rtv           "

Changed background to Water3
Commented out the terminal startups in i3 config
Edited i3 bar and i3 status config (~/.config/i3status.conf)
Installed (Font Awesome) and put it in ~/.fonts
Website for looking at Unicode Character Fonts: bluejamesbond.github.io/CharacterMap/


Installed rofi "sudo apt install rofi"
[1118]
rofi config (~/.config/rofi/config)
-This line had to be added to (compton config). Otherwise Rofi was treated as an unfocused window and therefore allways transperent. This line makes compton always consider rofi focused
"focus-exclude = ["_NET_WM_NAME@:s = 'rofi'"];"
Have to restart to take effect

-Made 'Scripts' directory in ~
 .wrote a script called 'hello'
 .to make a script usable the permisions need to be changed
	"chmod 755 PATH/TO/SCRIPT"
 
-Made scripts using Rofi's dmenu to create menus for launching terminal applications and power options
 .PowerOptions
 .TerminalApplications

Installed Vivaldi for Internet
Installed Zathura for pdfs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To check default for opening pdf:
	xdg-mime query default application/pdf

Supposed to be able to change the default by edditing
	~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list
but this didn't work when opening in ranger

To set default in ranger the rifle file needs to be eddited or open the file
by pressing 'r' and ranger provides a list of choices.

started working on changing zathura config in .config/zathura/zathurarc
there is a 'man zathurarc'

!!!zathura is fully configured !!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

mc - midnight commander
also changed Super from windows key to Alt
don't want to use nnn only because it's not as colorful as ranger
