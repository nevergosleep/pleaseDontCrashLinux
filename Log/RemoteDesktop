Remmina
	To install:	echo 'deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main' | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list.d/stretch-backports.list >> /dev/null
			sudo apt update
			sudo apt install -t streth-backports remmina remmina-plugin-rdp remmina-plugin-secret
	
	Performance:	Works well, on best quality everything looks perfect and most processes are fast
			The only think that is slow is transition animations. Might be possible to turn 
			off in remina settings.
